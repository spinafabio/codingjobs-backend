	Based on the 'Register_Exercise'.

	Edit the 'register.php' page.

	Now, the user can also upload a profile image.
	The image is not mandatory.

	For this you have to follow those steps : 
		1. On PHPMYADMIN, edit the 'user' table and add a new attribute : poster.
		2. Add the input to upload a file on the register form
		3. Create the PHP code that will save the file on the server ('uploads' folder)
		4. Grab the name of the image (only the name) and save it as user 'poster'
