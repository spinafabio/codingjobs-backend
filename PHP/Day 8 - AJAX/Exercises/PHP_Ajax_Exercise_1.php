	-- Exercise : 

	In this exercise, you will use the 'movie_db' database.

	- Step 1 :
		Create two pages: 'new-movie.html' and 'insert-movie.php'
	
	- Step 2: 'new-movie.html' should contain a form to insert a new movie.
		You should create all the necessary inputs.

		For now, the director id should be an input:number.
		
	- Step 3 :
		When clicking on submit button you must do an AJAX call to the 'insert-movie.php'
		This script will check if all the inputs are valid and try to insert a new movie in the Database.

	- Step 4 :
		If there is a problem with the form display an error message (color red)
		If everything went fine, display a success message (color green)

		
	TIPS : 
		You should display a list of directors (dropdown) in the form.
		User can select among all director and choose one of them to link it with the movie.
		BUILD THIS DROPDOWN MANUALLY (easiest solution)
